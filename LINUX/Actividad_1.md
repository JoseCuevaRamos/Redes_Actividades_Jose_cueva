# What is "the Shell"?
- Simply put, the shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. In the old days, it was the only user interface available on a Unix-like system such as Linux. Nowadays, we have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in addition to command line interfaces (CLIs) such as the shell.
- On most Linux systems a program called bash (which stands for Bourne Again SHell, an enhanced version of the original Unix shell program, sh, written by Steve Bourne) acts as the shell program. Besides bash, there are other shell programs available for Linux systems. These include: ksh, tcsh and zsh.
# What's a "Terminal?"
- It's a program called a terminal emulator. This is a program that opens a window and lets you interact with the shell. There are a bunch of different terminal emulators we can use. Some Linux distributions install several. These might include gnome-terminal, konsole, xterm, rxvt, kvt, nxterm, and eterm.

# Starting a Terminal
- Window managers usually have a way to launch a terminal from the menu. Look through the list of programs to see if anything looks like a terminal emulator. While there are a number of different terminal emulators, they all do the same thing. They give us access to a shell session. You will probably develop a preference for one, based on the different bells and whistles it provides.
# Testing the Keyboard
- OK, let's try some typing. Bring up a terminal window. The first thing we should see is a shell prompt that contains our user name and the name of the machine followed by a dollar sign. Something like this:
-Excellent! Now type some nonsense characters and press the enter key.
-If all went well, we should have gotten an error message complaining that it cannot understand the command:
