# Manipulating Files
This lesson will introduce the following commands:

- cp - copy files and directories
- mv - move or rename files and directories
- rm - remove files and directories
- mkdir - create directories
- These four commands are among the most frequently used Linux commands. They are the basic commands for manipulating both files and directories.

- Now, to be frank, some of the tasks performed by these commands are more easily done with a graphical file manager. With a file manager, you can drag and drop a file from one directory to another, cut and paste files, delete files, etc. So why use these old command line programs?

- The answer is power and flexibility. While it is easy to perform simple file manipulations with a graphical file manager, complicated tasks can be easier with the command line programs. For example, how would you copy all the HTML files from one directory to another, but only copy files that did not exist in the destination directory or were newer than the versions in the destination directory? Pretty hard with with a file manager. Pretty easy with the command line:

# cp
The cp program copies files and directories. In its simplest form, it copies a single file:
# mv
The mv command moves or renames files and directories depending on how it is used. It will either move one or more files to a different directory, or it will rename a file or directory. To rename a file, it is used like this:
# rm
The rm command removes (deletes) files and directories.
# mkdir
The mkdir command is used to create directories. To use it, you simply type:
